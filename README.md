This is a simple script I use for overlaying GPX data from my bike rides on Google Maps. Since I had a number of request from people wanting to do something similar, I decided to release this script. 

USAGE:

1. Open 'index.php' and update the Google Maps API key with your own.

2. You have the option of update the 'map.setCenter()' call as it is currently setup for downtown Toronto Ontario Canada. 

3. Place all valid GPS logs as .XML or .GPX documents in the 'gpx' directory. 

4. Profit..?
